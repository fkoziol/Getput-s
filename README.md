# Objective
As the name says, it is simply scrapping all the national assembly sessions.
The data is taken on the https://www.nosdeputes.fr/ website, which is not the official national assembly website, but is an anonymous citizen-produced website that gives a cleaner and more insightful version of the original sessions. They make it way easier to scrap while producing relevant data on their own (ex: tags, a deputy database, etc.)

# Output
The outputs are multiple JSON files that must be merged and treated. This will be done in a subsequent update.

# Future updates
- Scrapping the deputy database to get relevant informations per speaker on each session (ex: which party is he from)
- Producing descriptive stats
- NLP processing
